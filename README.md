Knuth Lee - An app to test the android screen orientation

======================

This app is developed to test the different activity required to support android screen orientation

The app consists of two activities: One for landscape mode and another for portrait mode.

Based on the screen orientation, different activity will be shown to the user though the activity name remains the same in both the cases.

This will be very useful to target bigger screen devices especially when we want to show some extra elements when the device goes to landscape mode.
